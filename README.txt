please run 'sudo docker-compose up -d' under 'docker-deploy' directory

run 'sudo docker ps' to check the id

run 'sudo docker kill <id>' to kill the daemon

after running the docker, the 'proxy.log' will be generated under ./docker-deploy/src

the 'hw2_requirements.xlsx', 'dangerlog.txt' and 'textcase.txt' are under root directory

'requirements.txt' has the totally same content as the 'hw2_requirements.xlsx', The txt format is only for the convenience of reading under linux
